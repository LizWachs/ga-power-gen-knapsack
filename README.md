# ga-power-gen-knapsack
Multi-objective optimization model based on knapsack problem for power generation using MATLAB ga.These are MATLAB livescripts with most dependencies.
Used two sample files from MATLAB: int_mutation and int_crossoverarithmetic, which are not included since they are proprietary from MATLAB. 
Data file is EnergySources.xlsx.
Used random seeds stored in Random_seeds.xlsx.

Main file is KnapsackmultiobjGA_overnightLCOE.mlx which uses the overnight costs to determine the LCOE.
The other main file is KnapsackmultiobjGA.mlx

Need is set at 10,000 MW, which can be changed by user.
